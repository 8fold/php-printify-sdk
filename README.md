# 8fold Printify SDK for PHP

{brief description}

## Installation

{how does one install the product}

## Usage

Still in progress. See tests for now.

## Details

The project's folder structure is designed to mirror the Printify API endpoint structures.

We delay API calls until the last responsible moment. We afford you the opportunity to do the same.

Methods starting with `get` perform API requests, specifically, a `GET` request.

Methods starting with `post` perform API requests, specifically, a `POST` request.

Methods starting with `delete` perform API requests, specifically, a `DELETE` request.

Methods starting with `put` perform API requests, specifically, a `PUT` request.
